Download and open the pcap  file on Wireshark
It has some hex code
Open terminal and use tshark and cut to extract those characters with the following command;

tshark -r ARP+Storm.pcap | cut -d "" -f119-20

use Tshark to remove unnecessary parts with the following command;

tshark -r ARP+Storm.pcap -Tfields -e arp.opcode | awk ‘{printf(“%c”,$1)}’

Then decode the output with base64

tshark -r ARP+Storm.pcap -Tfields -e arp.opcode | awk ‘{printf(“%c”,$1)}’ | base64 -d
